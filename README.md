# NLP_Final_Project

This repo contains codes we used for the Roku product analysis. 
We analyzed customers' opinions on different Roku versions using Tweets from Twitter and Amazon customer reviews. To collect the necessary data, we web-scrapped using Twitter's and Amazon's Rainforest API.

We then performed the topic modelling to extract popular topics from amazon reviews, and conducted the text analysis to identify what users like and dislike about their Roku products. Based on our findings, we provided business suggestions for the next product development.
